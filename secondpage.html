<h4>Hiking</h4>

  <p>
    My love from hiking comes from growing up in washington, but I try to explore new trails wherever I go! This past year, I went on hikes in 3 different states and Puerto Rico!
    1. Virginia
      In May, I visited a friend in Northern Virginia, and went on a beatufiul 9.3 mile hike in the Shenandoah National Park. 
    2. Washingotn
      I was back home for the second half of summer, and in my natural hiking habitat! 
      Some of my favorite trails in the Pacific Northwest are Mason lake, Annette Lake, and Rattlesnake Ledge, all in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.
    3 . New Hampshire
      Upon my return to Boston in September, I was on a mission to find some New England hikes before the weather got too cold. Mount Major in New Hampshire has some incredible scenery, especially
    when the leaves are changing color. 
    4. Puerto Rico
      After classes wrapped up in December, I went on a trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico to escape the Boston Winter. While there, I explored the El Yunque National Forest and went on a gorgeous 
    waterfall hike!
    
    I'm hoping 2025 will be a year with as many, if not more incredible hikes.

<h4>Reading</h4>

  <p>
    My reading habits tend to cycle from reading a book a day when I find myself with free time, to not reading one for a month when I am busy. When I find myself with 
    time to read, some of my favorite genres are Thrillers, Historical Fiction, and Fantasy. According to my Goodreads "My Year in Books" I read 25 books in 2024. 
    Reading highlights of the year:
    1. A Court of Thorns and Roses (5 book series) by Sarah J. Maas - I read this over the summer at the request of my friends, and I read these so fast, loved it!
    2. The Silent Patient by Alex Michaelides - At my Co-op this was a Young Professionals Network book club pick!
    3. Throne of Glass (7 book series - still in progress) by Sarah J. Maas - This one took me longer to get into, but has been on the up later in the series for me. 

    My reading goal for 2025 is 30 books (which I'm currently behind on) but I hope to get caught up once the semester slows down!

<h4>Coffee</h4>

  <p>
    My love of coffee is not necessairly something that came naturally to me, but rather was picked up while I worked as a barista in high school. I started working 
    at La FÃªte - a french patisserie - right when it opened in July 2020, primairly so I could stop working as a lifeguard at my local country club. I was not a coffee
    drinker when I started, but being scheduled for shifts at 5:30 in the morning quickly changed that for me. Now, 5 years later, my mom says that I became a 
    "coffee snob" at too young of an age - even though its a trait I share with my dad. 

    While the boston coffee scene, is not nearly comparable to that of Seattle, I have found some cafes that have become fast favorites of mine.

    1. Blank Street
    2. Thinking Cup
    3. Blue Bottle
    4. Farmers Horse
    5. Capital One Cafe (50% off for Capital One card holders)

<h4>Food</h4>

  <p>
    At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic I decided to try being vegetairan. I had never attempted this before (mostly because my mom wouldn't let me)
    but 5 years later, I've stuck with it. Naturally this introduces some food complications when it comes to what restaurants I can find half decent veggie food at. 
    It also challenges me to get a bit more creative when it comes to meal planning (which im not great at) and deciding what to make myself. 
    
    Some of my favorite (veggie friendly) restaurants:
    1. Krasi - Mediterranean Restaurant in Back Bay, this is my all time favorite Boston restaurant, unfortunatley it can be very dificult to get a reservation at.
    2. Carmelina's - There are endless Italian restaurants in Boston's North End and you will mostly find the same menu items at all of them, but Carmelina's is worth a visit.
    3. Banyan Bar + Refuge - For a more casual dinner in the South End this Asian Fusion restaurant has figured out how to do vegetarian (and non veg) right. 
    4. Mela  -Also located in the South End Neighborhood, if you like Indian food, this is the place to go for a delicious meal!
