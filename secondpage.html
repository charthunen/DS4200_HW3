<h4>Hiking</h4>
<p>
    My love for hiking comes from growing up in Washington, but I try to explore new trails wherever I go! This past year, I went on hikes in three different states and Puerto Rico:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Virginia:</b> In May, I visited a friend in Northern Virginia and went on a beautiful 9.3-mile hike in Shenandoah National Park.</li>
    <li><b>Washington:</b> I was back home for the second half of summer, in my natural hiking habitat! Some of my favorite trails in the Pacific Northwest are Mason Lake, Annette Lake, and Rattlesnake Ledge, all in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.</li>
    <li><b>New Hampshire:</b> Upon my return to Boston in September, I was on a mission to find some New England hikes before the weather got too cold. Mount Major in New Hampshire offers incredible scenery, especially when the leaves are changing color.</li>
    <li><b>Puerto Rico:</b> After classes wrapped up in December, I traveled to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to escape the Boston winter. While there, I explored El Yunque National Forest and went on a gorgeous waterfall hike!</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I'm hoping 2025 will be a year with just as many, if not more, incredible hikes!
</p>

<h4>Reading</h4>
<p>
    My reading habits tend to cycle—I can go from reading a book a day when I have free time to not reading one for a month when I'm busy. When I do read, I enjoy Thrillers, Historical Fiction, and Fantasy. According to my Goodreads "My Year in Books," I read 25 books in 2024. Some of my highlights:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>A Court of Thorns and Roses</b> (5-book series) by Sarah J. Maas – I read this over the summer at the request of my friends, and I flew through it!</li>
    <li><b>The Silent Patient</b> by Alex Michaelides – A pick from my Young Professionals Network book club at my Co-op.</li>
    <li><b>Throne of Glass</b> (7-book series, still in progress) by Sarah J. Maas – It took me longer to get into, but it’s been improving as the series goes on.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    My reading goal for 2025 is 30 books (I'm currently behind), but I hope to catch up once the semester slows down!
</p>

<h4>Coffee</h4>
<p>
    My love of coffee wasn’t something that came naturally to me—I picked it up while working as a barista in high school. I started at La Fête, a French patisserie, when it opened in July 2020, mainly so I could stop working as a lifeguard at my local country club. I wasn’t a coffee drinker when I started, but 5:30 AM shifts quickly changed that! Now, five years later, my mom says I became a "coffee snob" too young—even though it’s a trait I share with my dad.
</p>
<p>
    While Boston's coffee scene doesn’t quite compare to Seattle’s, I’ve found some cafés that have become fast favorites:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Blank Street</li>
    <li>Thinking Cup</li>
    <li>Blue Bottle</li>
    <li>Farmer's Horse</li>
    <li>Capital One Café (50% off for Capital One cardholders)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Food</h4>
<p>
    At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to try being vegetarian. I had never attempted it before (mostly because my mom wouldn’t let me), but five years later, I’ve stuck with it. Naturally, this introduces some food challenges when finding good vegetarian options at restaurants. It also pushes me to be more creative with meal planning (which I’m not great at).
</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorite veggie-friendly restaurants in Boston:</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Krasi:</b> A Mediterranean restaurant in Back Bay—my all-time favorite in Boston! Unfortunately, it’s tough to get a reservation.</li>
    <li><b>Carmelina’s:</b> The North End has endless Italian restaurants, but Carmelina’s is worth a visit.</li>
    <li><b>Banyan Bar + Refuge:</b> A casual Asian Fusion spot in the South End that does both vegetarian and non-veg options right.</li>
    <li><b>Mela:</b> Also in the South End, this is the go-to spot for amazing Indian food!</li>
</ul>
