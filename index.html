    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Charlotte, I am a Third year at Northeastern University pursuing a BS in Business Administration and Data 
        Science with a concentration in Brand Management.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am originally from Seattle, Washington, where I grew an appreciation for the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest, 
        and specialty coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      On campus I am involved in several extracurriculars, including, Sigma Kappa Sorority, Women in Business, and WISE. 
        Being involved in these organizations has provided me with a community and network of strong women who have 
        supported me throughout my college journey and provided me with invaluable leadership experiences. I am the 
        current president of the Sigma Kappa, Kappa Omega chapter, and I have also held roles as the Vice President of 
        Academic Excellence, and the Activities Chair. In Women In Business, I have had the pleasure of being a peer mentor 
        for the past two semesters. This is a program where you are paired with underclassmen, and become a resource for them 
        regarding classes, co-op search, and concentration selection. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I love spending my free time exploring Boston's many coffee shops and restaurants, running along the Charles River,
        and hanging out with friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my time at Northeastern, I have completed two Marketing internships for Proxi Co and Relish (Seattle, WA), and 
        one co-op as a project manager at MFS Investment Management (Boston, MA). After graduation, I plan to pursue a 
        career in a Technical industry where I hope to combine my business and Data Science roles. 
    </p>
