    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi! My name is Charlotte, I am a Third year at Northeastern University pursuing a BS in Business Administration and Data Science with a concentration in Brand Management.

      I am originally from Seattle, Washingoton, where I grew an appreciation for the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest, and specialty coffee.
      
      On campus I am involved in several extracurriculars, including, Sigma Kappa Sorority, Women in Business, and WISE. I love spending my free time exploring Boston's many coffee 
      shops and restaurants, running along the charles river, and hanging out with friends. 
      
      In my time at Northeastern, I have completed two Marketing internships for Proxi Co and Relish (Seattle, WA), and one co-op 
      as a project manager at MFS Investment Management (Boston, MA). After graduation, I plant to pursue a career in a Technical industry where I hope to combine my 
      business and Data Science roles.
